						Nigeria faces a staggering 28-million-unit housing deficit,
						resulting in home rental prices too high for most people's income.
						While the government struggles to address this, Akara is stepping up
						with a mission to help bridge this gap over the next 25 years or
						more through the power of technology and community. By enabling
						participation with as little as â‚¦1,000, we're making it possible for
						Nigerians of all walks of life to co-own micro units of thousands of
						crowd-financed Affordable Rental Housing projects across the
						country. This would ultimately create enough supply to cause rental
						prices to become more budget-friendly for millions of hardworking
						Nigerians
